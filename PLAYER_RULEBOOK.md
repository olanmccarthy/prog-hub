## The Session Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Session Start & Deck Submission
1. **Admin starts the session** - A new session becomes active
2. **All players submit decklists** - Upload your .ydk deck file that conforms to the current session's banlist
   - Your deck must be legal according to the active banlist
   - Decklist format: .ydk files (exportable from most deck builders)
   - **Everyone must submit before the event wheel can be spun**

### Phase 2: Event Wheel
3. **Admin spins the event wheel** - A random event is selected that may affect the tournament
   - Events are weighted by percentage chance
   - Examples: Draft formats, bonus packs, special rules
   - Some sessions may have "No Event" if the wheel lands on it

### Phase 3: Tournament Play
4. **Pairings are generated** - Round-robin pairings for all players
   - Discord notification sent with all matchups
   - View pairings on the Pairings page
5. **Play matches on Dueling Book** - Complete your matches
6. **Report match results** - Update win counts for each pairing
   - Players can update their own match results
   - Continue until all matches are complete

### Phase 4: Results & Rankings
7. **Admin finalizes standings** - Final rankings are calculated
   - **Tiebreakers** (in order):
     1. Match Wins
     2. Game Wins in Lost Matches (higher is better)
     3. Game Losses in Won Matches (lower is better)
     4. Head-to-Head Result (winner ranks higher)
   - Top 6 placements are locked in
   - **Decklists become public** after standings are finalized
   - Discord notification sent with final standings

### Phase 5: Victory Point Distribution
8. **Admin initiates Victory Point Assignment** - The "passdown system" begins
   - Starting with 1st place, each player is offered **1 Victory Point**
   - **If you take the VP:**
     - You get 1 Victory Point added to your total
     - All other players (except last place) receive Wallet Points based on placement
   - **If you pass:**
     - The offer moves to the next player in rankings
   - **Last place must accept** if everyone passes
   - Only 1 VP is awarded per session

9. **Wallet Points are distributed automatically**
   - Distribution based on active Wallet Point Breakdown configuration
   - Example: 1st place gets 100 points, 2nd gets 80, etc.
   - **Last place (6th) receives NO wallet points** regardless of who takes VP
   - All transactions are logged and visible in your transaction history

### Phase 6: Banlist Evolution
10. **All players submit banlist suggestions**
    - Submit your proposed changes for the next session
    - Format: Specify which cards should be Banned, Limited, Semi-Limited, or Unlimited
    - **Everyone must submit a suggestion before voting begins**

11. **All players vote on banlist suggestions**
    - **Minimum 2 votes required** per player
    - **Cannot vote for your own suggestion**
    - View all submitted suggestions and vote with thumbs up
    - **Everyone must vote before the moderator can be selected**

12. **Admin selects the moderator via random wheel**
    - Each eligible player has equal chance
    - Previous session's moderator is typically excluded
    - The moderator will choose the winning banlist

13. **Moderator chooses the winning banlist**
    - Moderator views all suggestions that received 2+ votes
    - Selects the winning suggestion
    - The new banlist is created by merging the winning suggestion with the current banlist:
      - Cards mentioned in the suggestion move to new categories
      - Cards not mentioned stay in their current categories
      - New cards are added
    - Moderator can change their selection until session is completed

## Victory Points & Wallet Points

### Victory Points
**What are they?**
- The primary ranking metric across all sessions

**The Passdown System:**
1. After standings are finalized, 1st place is offered the VP
2. They can:
   - **Take it:** Get 1 VP, everyone else gets Wallet Points
   - **Pass:** Offer moves to 2nd place
3. If everyone passes, last place must accept

**Why pass?**
- If you're confident you'll place well in future sessions, you might pass so you can earn Wallet Points instead
- Strategic decision based on your collection and deck strength

### Wallet Points (Dollarydoos)
**What are they?**
- Currency for purchasing sets in the Shop
- Earned when someone else takes the Victory Point
- Distribution based on placement (1st gets most, last gets none)

**How distribution works:**
- When a player takes the VP, all others receive Wallet Points
- Amount varies by placement (e.g., 1st: 100, 2nd: 80, 3rd: 60, 4th: 40, 5th: 20, 6th: 0)
- **Last place (6th) always receives 0 Wallet Points**
- Exact amounts depend on active Wallet Point Breakdown configuration

**Viewing your wallet:**

- View transaction history to see all credits and debits
- Transactions show: Victory Point awards, Shop purchases, Manual adjustments

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I change my decklist after submitting?**
A: Yes, you can resubmit before the event wheel is spun. Latest submission counts.

**Q: What happens if I don't submit a decklist?**
A: The session cannot proceed until all players submit. Please submit promptly.

**Q: Can I see other players' decklists?**
A: Only after standings are finalized for that session. Past sessions are always viewable.

**Q: What if there's a dispute about match results?**
A: Contact an admin immediately. Both players can update results, but admins have final say.

**Q: Should I take the Victory Point or pass?**
A: It's a strategic decision. Take it if you want the VP for overall rankings. Pass if you'd rather have Wallet Points to buy more sets.

**Q: Can the moderator vote for their own suggestion?**
A: No, just like everyone else, moderators cannot vote for their own suggestion.

**Q: How do tiebreakers work?**
A: Match Wins → Game Wins in Lost Matches → Game Losses in Won Matches → Head-to-Head Result

**For 2-player ties:** We look at their direct match. Winner ranks higher.

**For 3+ player ties:** We create mini-standings using ONLY matches between the tied players, then apply ALL THREE tiebreakers again within that group:
1. Match wins (in mini-standings)
2. Game wins in lost matches (in mini-standings)
3. Game losses in won matches (in mini-standings)

This process is **recursive** - if a 4-way tie becomes a 3-way tie, we repeat the process.

**Example 1 - Clear resolution:**
- A, B, C tied overall
- Mini-standings: A beat B and C (2-0), B beat C (1-1), C lost both (0-2)
- Result: A (1st), B (2nd), C (3rd)

**Example 2 - Circular tie (resolved):**
- A, B, C tied overall
- Mini-standings: A beat B 2-0, B beat C 2-1, C beat A 2-1
- All have 1-1 match record in mini-standings, but:
  - A: 0 game wins in losses, 0 game losses in wins (best)
  - B: 1 game win in losses, 1 game loss in wins
  - C: 1 game win in losses, 1 game loss in wins
- Result: A (1st), then B and C need 2-player head-to-head (B wins)
- Final: A (1st), B (2nd), C (3rd)

**Example 3 - Perfectly symmetric tie (random resolution):**
- A beat B 2-1, B beat C 2-1, C beat A 2-1 (perfect circle)
- Mini-standings: All 1-1 with identical game stats
- Result: No objective tiebreaker exists - **players are randomly ordered** for fairness
- Note: This is extremely rare and requires perfectly mirrored match results

**Q: Can I buy sets from future sessions?**
A: No, only sets released before the next session's date are available.

**Q: What happens to my Wallet Points if I don't spend them?**
A: They carry over indefinitely. You can save up for expensive sets.

**Q: Can admins see my wallet balance?**
A: Yes, admins can see all player information. Leaderboard shows everyone's balance.

**Good luck, and may the heart of the cards be with you!**
